# About the Word Game
This is a game inspired by the game Wordle. The game is build with React and the game logic is on the backend with Node and an Express server. There is also a serverside rendered highscore page that uses Handlebars as the template engine and renders highscores from a MongoDB database. The backend uses Mongoose for handeling the database. Both the frontend and backend is developed with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS is used for styling. Jest is used to test the game logic.
